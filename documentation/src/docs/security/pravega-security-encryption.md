# Pravega Encryption
## Encryption of data in flight 
Pravega ensures that all the data in flight can be passed on in an encrytped manner.
The different channels [channels](https://github.com/pravega/pravega/wiki/PDP-23:-Pravega-security----encryption-and-Role-Based-Access-Control#b-encryption-of-data-in-flight-over-network-and-in-tier-1)
can be configured with TLS and encryption enabled for them.
### Certificate management
Pravega expects administrator user to create and manage certificate creation, deployment and management. 
Pravega provides different configuration parameters where certificates for different communication channels can be specified.
### Encrypted data flow between Pravega client and Pravega controller and segmentstore
Pravega uses same cert to interact with both controller and segmentstore. The certificates need to be mentioned specifically on the client and the server.
These certificates are not loaded from the trust store.
### Encrypted data flow between Pravega and tier-1 (Apache Bookkeeper)
Apache bookkeeper supports JKS based truststore. Segmentstore uses JKS based truststore to interact with it. The configurations
#### Segmentstore and bookkeeper
Pravega Segmentstore uses Apache bookkeeper as Tier-1 storage. 
Interactions between segmentstore
### Encrypted access to Apache Zookeeper
This implementation is still in [progress](https://github.com/pravega/pravega/issues/2034). 
## Encryption of data at rest
### Encryption of data in tier2
Pravega can work with multiple tier2 implementations. Currently we have HDFS, extended S3 and filesystem (NFS) as tier2 implementations.
 These tier2 can be independantly configured to enable encryption. This is transperant to how Pravega interacts with them.
 
### Encryption of data in tier1 
Pravega users Apache BookKeeper as tier1 implementation.
